## OpenCV basics

The goal of this repository is to walk through some basic functions and capabilities of OpenCV such as image translation and rotation, image filtering, morphological operations, etc.

### Zadatak1

Implementation of functions for rotation and translation

### Zadatak2

Applying a filter to a noisy image. Implementation of a function that adds salt and paper noise to an image

### Zadatak3

Edge detection in image processing

### Zadatak4

Grayscale histogram. Binary thresholding operations.

### Zadatak5

Morphological operations in image processing.

### Zadatak6

Simple Cifar10 CNN Keras code with 88% Accuracy
